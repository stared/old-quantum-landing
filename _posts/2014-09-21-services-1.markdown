description: |
---

Play for fun! Learn quantum mechanics as a side effect.

It's a puzzle game, heavily inspired by The Incredible Machine and Chromatron.

All you need is a browser (we recommend recent version of Firefox or Chrome), you don't need to install anything.

It's open source - so not only you can play it for free, but also lookup the code. Motivation behind the game is in [Quantum mechanics for high-school students](http://p.migdal.pl/2016/08/15/quantum-mechanics-for-high-school-students.html) blog post.
