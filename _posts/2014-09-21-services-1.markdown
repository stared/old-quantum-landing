**NEWS: We develop Quantum Game v 2.0 at CQT, Singapore. See updates at [Medium](https://medium.com/quantum-photons) or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/QuantumGameIO). We will release it late 2019.**

Play for fun! Learn quantum mechanics as a side effect.

It's a puzzle game, heavily inspired by The Incredible Machine and Chromatron.

All you need is a browser (we recommend recent version of Firefox or Chrome), you don't need to install anything.

It's open source - so not only you can play it for free, but also lookup the code. Motivation behind the game is in [Quantum mechanics for high-school students](http://p.migdal.pl/2016/08/15/quantum-mechanics-for-high-school-students.html) blog post.

It was covered on [The Quantum Times](http://thequantumtimes.org/2017/03/gamifying-quantum-theory/) (top pick in **education** for gamifying quantum theory), [Motherboard](https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/a3jkya/quantum-game-physics-computer-puzzle), [Scott Aaronson](https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=3597), [Cory Doctorow](https://boingboing.net/2017/12/15/schroedingers-browser.html), [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=14432176) (actually, [twice](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=15905924)).
