Sandbox mode allows experimenting with physics, creating new levels and having fun. It's why we called it *adventures of a curious character*. :)

Replicate famous (real and gedanken) experiments like:

* [Michelson interferometer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michelson_interferometer)
* [Mach–Zehnder interferometer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mach%E2%80%93Zehnder_interferometer)
* [Sagnac interferometer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common-path_interferometer)
* [Elitzur–Vaidman bomb tester](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elitzur%E2%80%93Vaidman_bomb_tester)

Underneath there is s real simulator of quantum mechanics - a discrete variant describing polarization and discrete position. You may be not aware of unitary and projective operators, tensor products or complex number - but JavaScript is doing all the dark magic for you!
